# Deep-learning-with-cats

I am trying to learn deep learning on a practical level and this repository is for that purpose. I have a few subprojects in mind, all having to do with cats.

**Using**
* Pytorch
* Jupyter notebook
* Geforce 1060

**Dataset**

*Cat Dataset*

**Objectives (so far)**
* Generate images of cats using various types of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
   * Starting with WGAN
  * When it will be possible to implement in Pytorch (not currently possible), try WGAN-IP
  * Then possibly try BEGAN
